You'll need the CLI release of PHP. For example, on Debian/Ubuntu, you will need to run :\r\n\r\n```\r\napt-get install php5-pgsql php5-cli\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Flash graphics with Open Flash Chart**\r\n\r\nYou can have flash graphics for databases' size, tablespaces's size and tables's size. To activate the graphs, you need to download Open Flash Chart PHP library from its website. Then, you have to extract four files: open_flash_chart_object.php, open-flash-chart.php, open-flash-chart.swf, and swfobject.js. pgsnap needs to find these files in the external directory.\r\n\r\n\r\n# How to use\r\n\r\n``` \r\n./pgsnap [OPTIONS]...
