Flash graphics with Open Flash Chart
------------------------------------

You can have flash graphics for databases' size, tablespaces's size and
tables's size. To activate the graphs, you need to download Open Flash Chart
PHP library from:
  http://teethgrinder.co.uk/open-flash-chart/

Then, you have to extract four files: open_flash_chart_object.php,
open-flash-chart.php, open-flash-chart.swf, and swfobject.js. pgsnap needs to
find these files in the external directory.
